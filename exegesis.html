                        <h1>Exegesis and Eisegesis</h1>
                        <p>Our very first unit in this class taught us about different ways to study or approach a text. The different perspectives that we used fell under the overarching term <b>hermeneutics</b>, which is the study of how humans interpret sacred texts.</p>
                        <p>There were two different ideologies that we studied:</p>
                        <h3>Exegesis</h3>
                        <p>The first ideology that we learned was <b>exegesis</b>, which is to interpret a text while considering the context of the original author. This can help us to all be on the same page and interpret the scriptures in the way that it was supposed to be read.</p>
                        <p>For example, we know that Satan can twist the scriptures and use half truths to get people to follow his ways. This way of interpreting scripture (twisting the meaning through isolating scriptures from their contexts) runs contrary to the idea of exegesis.</p>
                        <p>Using exegesis as a strategy can produce powerful results because we are more sure that we are interpreting God's word in the way that He wants us to. Exegesis can also open us up to some powerful insights that we wouldn't notice if we only read the scripture through our own modern lens.</p>
                        <h3>Eisegesis</h3>
                        <p>The second ideology that we studied was <b>eisegesis</b>, which is to interpret scripture from our own perspective. This helps us to not just learn about other people, but to also benefit in our own lives by learning lessons that we can apply.</p>
                        <p>Nephi gives us a clear example of what eisegesis looks like when he says that "I did liken all scriptures unto us, that it might be for our profit and learning" (<a href="https://site.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/19?lang=eng&id=23" target="_blank">1 Nephi 19:23</a>).</p>
                        <p>The keyword from his words is <i>profit</i>. Exegesis allows us to learn, but it's eisegesis that allows us to profit and live better lives as a result of our scripture study.</p>
                        <h3>Application</h3>
                        <p>We can apply this lesson by:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Learning the context around the verses we are reading</li>
                            <li>Considering how stories or teachings presented can be applied to our lives</li>
                            <li>Using a combination of the two</li>
                        </ul>
