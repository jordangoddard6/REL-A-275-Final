                        <h1>Authors and Redactors</h1>
                        <p>The Book of Mormon is written primarily through <b>redaction</b>, which is the process of taking and expanding upon existing sources to make an entirely new document.</p>
                        <p>Such a redaction is created by a <b>redactor</b>, who is someone that is somewhere between an author and an editor. A redactor is an author because they will add their own thoughts and perspectives to the previously existing text. A redactor is also an editor because they pick which parts of a document to include in their new work.</p>
                        <p>The Book of Mormon is clear and digestible because of the work of its redactors. The three redactors of the Book of Mormon are <b>Nephi</b>, <b>Mormon</b>, and <b>Moroni</b>. These three men took previously existing historical documents and information and changed them into narratives that we could more easily follow and relate to. They also filtered out the mundane and secular parts in order to give us the more spiritual parts of their history.</p>
                        <p>There are at least 4 ways that we see evidence of Mormon's redaction:</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>"Thus we see" or other summaries of lessons to learn</li>
                            <li>Explanations of the Nephite society</li>
                            <li>Noting when an event is fulfillment of prophecy</li>
                            <li>Foreshadowing</li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>Knowing about the redactors of the Book of Mormon and the redaction process helps it to become more relatable to me. Instead of wondering whether the lessons pointed out are coming from an unnamed omniscient narrator, I can instead know that the voice is that of a friend. It also helps me see the Book of Mormon more as a process instead of a one-time miracle. It helps me truly see that God uses His children to accomplish His work.</p>
                        <h3>Applications</h3>
                        <p>We can apply this lesson by:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Recognizing the input of the redactor</li>
                            <li>Gaining a testimony of the divine calling of the redactor</li>
                            <li>Internalizing that God does His work through His children</li>
                        </ul>
