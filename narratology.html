                        <h1>Narratology</h1>
                        <p>Our narratology lesson taught us about the significance of God teaching us through stories. A term that we learned in this lesson is <b>narrative theology</b>.</p> 
                        <p>Narrative theology is looking at the Bible, or a work of scripture, as a whole in order to extract from it God's character. We do this by seeing God's character through what we see Him do rather than what we are told about Him. What we are told about Him can help to serve our understanding, but the basis, in this ideology, is the actions are present in the story.</p>
                        <p>An important part of narrative theology is to look at what's there instead of trying to look past it. For example, Bible scholars may want to use scriptures as a historical record that can help them to better understand the society that the people are a part of. However, narrative theology will not do that, but instead look at the picture that has been painted by the author in order to teach us about God.</p>
                        <p>Another part is to look at the narrator. Even if the author and narrator are the same person, there is a difference between them. We are able to pick out the attitude of the narrator by looking at the way they describe different people or places. Noticing this helps us to look at the story that way that the narrator wants us to.
