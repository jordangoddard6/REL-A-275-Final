                        <h1>Plan of Salvation</h1>
                        <p>The Book of Mormon teaches us many things about the Plan of Salvation. I will focus on 3 in this post: the <b>3 Pillars of Eternity</b>; the <b>purposes of the Plan of Salvation</b>; and the <b>two spiritual deaths</b>.</p>
                        <h3>3 Pillars of Eternity</h3>
                        <p>The 3 Pillars of Eternity are, in order, the <b>Creation</b>, the <b>Fall</b>, and the <b>Atonement of Jesus Christ</b>. These 3 ideas are foundational to the plan itself, as it would falter if any of these 3 were taken away. Additionally, a good understanding of the Plan of Salvation requires an accurate comprehension of these 3 events. Many missionaries throughout the Book of Mormon point to these events when teaching the people about God's plan.</p>
                        <p>Basically, these pillars teach us that God created us for this mortal experience, yet we are in a fallen state from which we have to be saved by Jesus Christ if this mortal experience is to bring us to God's stature and presence. That, in a nutshell, is the Plan of Salvation.</p>
                        <h3>Purposes of the Plan of Salvation</h3>
                        <p>I just alluded to the 2 purposes of the Plan of Salvation above, but I will restate them more clearly here.</p>
                        <p>The two purposes are:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>To return to God's presence</li>
                                <li>To become like God</li>
                            </ul>
                        <p>A knowledge of the Plan is incomplete without either of these two items. The plan is not for us to just become like God, nor is it just for us to return to His presence. It is both a plan of <b>where we should be</b> and <b>who we should be</b>. Both of these ideas are taught in the Book of Mormon.</p>
                        <h3>Two Spiritual Deaths</h3>
                        <p>Samuel the Lamanite, in his sermon atop the Zarahemla city wall, teaches us some things about the Plan of Salvation. One of these important ideas is about the different kinds of death, including the two spiritual deaths.</p>
                        <p>Because of the Fall of Adam and Eve, one of the pillars of eternity, we experience two kinds of death: physical and spiritual. <b>Physical</b> in that we will die while we are here on Earth. <b>Spiritual</b> in that we are separated from the presence of God.</p>
                        <p>These two deaths, however, are no fault of our own, and through God's justice and mercy, Christ was sent to save us from them. At the end of the day, all of God's children will overcome these two deaths through Resurrection and through being brought back into the presence of God on Judgement Day.</p>
                        <p>However, not everyone will remain in the presence of God after judgement. Those who leave His presence will experience a second, final spiritual death. In essence, we are freely given relief from the first spiritual death, but relief from the second spiritual death through Christ the Lord is based upon our faithfulness to Him. We are given agency, and it is up to us to choose what we want to happen.</p>
                        <h3>Applications</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Study the 3 Pillars of Eternity</li>
                            <li>Choose to repent and one day overcome spiritual death</li>
                            <li>Teach the purposes of the Plan of Salvation</li>
                        </ul>
