                        <p>This class has been so good to me! Usually I dread doing my homework. It's the last thing that I want to do. However, throughout this term, I have been excited whenever I have the chance to sit down and work on this class.</p>
                        <p>I haven't studied the Book of Mormon this in depth since my mission. Lately, I have been thinking that I know most of what there is to know about the Book of Mormon. I had read it a few times, and I was decently familiar with the stories. I really didn't think that there was much more for me to get from it, so I was really lacking motivation to read and study.</p>
                        <p>However, my eyes have been opened thanks to this class. I have learned so many new things from this class. It's clear to me now that I will never finish my study of the Book of Mormon, but there is always something new to break down and learn, especially with all the different tools for study that we've been given throughout the course of this class.</p>
                        <p>I also can't believe that we're not done learning about the Book of Mormon as a church in general. It was crazy to me to see that there are professors doing research on the Book of Mormon and unearthing new statistics, ideas, teachings, or insights that we hadn't had in the past. For some reason, I thought that because the book came straight from God to us, and is written for us, that we knew everything that there is to know about it already. I have been humbled to learn that this is not the case.</p>
                        <p>We are taught to seek learning by study and by faith. What I've said above has shown what I have learned by study. I have also learned by faith this term. I have prayed for help to know how to apply the Book of Mormon to me and become a better disciple of Christ. It has worked and my testimony has grown. I am so blessed to have been in this class.</p>
