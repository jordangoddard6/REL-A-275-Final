                        <h1>Atonement</h1>
                        <p>There has never been a greater testimony of the Atonement of Jesus Christ than the Book of Mormon. Although other books of scripture discuss Christ's role as Savior, no book takes as expansive of a look at what He has done and can do for us than the Book of Mormon. For example, the Book of Mormon uses the words "atonement" or "atone" 39 times (<a href="https://bookofmormonstudynotes.blog/2019/01/30/how-is-the-word-atonement-used-in-the-book-of-mormon/" target="_blank">Source</a>).</p>
                        <h3>The Word "Atonement"</h3>
                        <p>The word "Atonement" literally means to bring two different things together into unity with each other. However, the word Atonement is used a little differently in the Book of Mormon, and it affects how we use the word in the church today.</p>
                        <p>In the Book of Mormon, the word "Atonement" usually is representative of everything that Christ has done for us in order to bring us back into the presence of the Father. In that case, it is a word that essentially belongs to Christ. It is a noun that it tied to Him. When you hear the word "Atonement" at church meeting, then often this is the meaning that should be taken from the usage.</p>
                        <h3>Little Children</h3>
                        <p>The Book of Mormon, both during King Benjamin's sermon and Moroni's last words, teaches us that Christ covers for the sins of little children. They are not accountable for the sins that they commit, because Christ has taken them upon himself.</p>
                        <p>This gives us hope when a little child is lost. While still being a overwhelming period of grief, some solace can be found in the fact that that child will be saved in the kingdom of God because of Christ.</p>
                        <h3>Therapeutic and Enabling Powers</h3>
                        <p>Christ, through the Atonement that he wrought, is able to not only forgive and cleanse us of our sins, but he is also able to give us power in other ways.</p>
                        <p>One of these is Christ's <b>therapeutic</b> power. We learn from Alma that Christ suffered for our pains, weaknesses, sicknesses, and grief, in addition to our sins. Because of this experience that He had with our hardships, He has power to understand our pains and succor us. We can be comforted through the Holy Spirit. We will never be left alone.</p>
                        <p>Another is Christ's <b>enabling</b> power. Moroni teaches us near the end of the Book of Mormon that we can become perfect through Christ. Thus, Christ can help us to become something that we aren't. He also helps us to accomplish tasks that we wouldn't be able to on our own.</p>
                        <h3>Applications</h3>
                        <p>We can apply this lesson by:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Seeking Christ's help with tasks that are hard for us</li>
                            <li>Finding Christ's healing power when we are grappling with hard emotions or experiences</li>
                            <li>Repenting of our sins</li>
                        </ul>
